# SkillsOnDemand
Final project for web application development class

The purpose of Skills On Demand is to help connect people with skills and people in need of skills to complete tasks or just to learn them. We are talking about any type of skill, maybe you know certain programming language too well, maybe you are a very good handyman, or maybe you are good planning small events. Anyone will be able to post their skills they are willing to share with the world. The users will also be able to search for someone with certain skill to learn a skill or perform certain task. In this way we could have a network in which a person can spread their knowledge, while the other person can learn from them or accomplish a task.
